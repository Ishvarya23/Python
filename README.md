Sales Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of sales data for the years 2003, 2004, and (partially) 2005.

Key Findings

Sales Growth: Sales have increased by 25% from 2003 to 2004. While data for 2005 is only available until May, it suggests a continuing upward trend with a 26% increase year-on-year for those months.
Product Performance: Classic cars lead in sales, accounting for 39.07%. Classic and vintage cars combined contribute to over 50% of total sales.
Sales-Deal Size Correlation: There's a strong positive correlation (0.86) between sales volume and deal size. This suggests that larger deals drive higher sales figures.
Product Size Distribution: Medium-sized products are sold more frequently compared to small and large products. A correlation coefficient of 1 might have been observed if large products were sold in higher quantities.
Regional Sales: The EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) region leads in terms of both sales volume and deal size. North America follows in second place, with the APAC (Asia Pacific) region coming in third.
Top Selling Category: Classic cars contribute the most significantly to overall sales.
